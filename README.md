# SIAM X ICP | Look Who Committed

SIAM X ICP | Look Who Committed is a beginner friendly project created to help students learn Git, GitHub, and open source contribution by actually doing it.

Instead of only watching tutorials or reading guides, contributors learn the real workflow by forking a repository, adding their details, committing changes, and opening a pull request.
